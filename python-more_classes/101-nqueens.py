Module 101-nqueens
===================
This module solves the N queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.
The N queens problem is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens
on an NÃ—N chessboard. This means no two queens can share the same row, column,
or diagonal.

The solution is printed as a list of lists, where each inner list contains
the row and column positions of a queen on the board.
"""


def print_solution(solution):
    """
    Prints the board configuration for a solution.

    Args:
        solution (list): A list of lists, where each inner list represents
        the position of a queen as [row, column].

    Example:
        [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]] represents queens placed at:
        - Row 0, Column 1
        - Row 1, Column 3
        - Row 2, Column 0
        - Row 3, Column 2

def is_safe(board, row, col):
    """
    Checks if it's safe to place a queen at the given board position (row, col)
    A position is safe if no queens are attacking each other. This means there
    should be no other queens in the same column, or on the same diagonal.

    Args:
        board (list): A list where the index represents the row and the value
                      represents the column of a queen.
        row (int): The current row index where we are trying to place a queen.
        col (int): The column index where we are trying to place a queen.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the position is safe, False otherwise.

        represents the column position of the queen in that row.
        row (int): The current row index where we are trying to place a queen.
